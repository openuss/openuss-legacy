welcome_openuss_introduction=OpenUSS ist eine Lernplattform, die an der Westf\u00E4lischen Wilhelms-Universit\u00E4t M\u00FCnster entwickelt wurde. Sie steht unter der GNU General Public License, einer weitverbreiteten Open-Source-Lizenz. Das System hebt sich von anderen Open-Source-basierten E-Learning-Systemen durch die konsequente Nutzung von Java-Technologien ab. Auf diese Weise k\u00F6nnen die Vorteile einer modernen Programmiersprache genutzt werden, die sich insbesondere im Rahmen der evolution\u00E4ren Weiterentwicklung und Wartung positiv bemerkbar machen. Dar\u00FCber hinaus gestattet die Nutzung des Frameworks Spring als Komponententechnologie die beliebige Verteilung und Skalierung des Systems. Infolgedessen eignet sich das System auch zur Bearbeitung hoher Lasten. Der vollst\u00E4ndige Quelltext des Systems, das mittlerweile in mehreren Sprachen verf\u00FCgbar ist, befindet sich unter SourceForge. Im Verlauf des Sommersemesters 2007 wurde im Rahmen eines Forschungsprojekts eine komplett neue Version des Systems entwickelt.
