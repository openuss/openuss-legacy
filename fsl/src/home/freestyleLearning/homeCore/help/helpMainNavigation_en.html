<h2>Main Navigation Buttons</h2>
<p>Once you <a href="helpMainSelectView_en.html">entered a view</a>, you can select Elements from the <a href="helpMainStructureTree_en.html">Structure Tree Panel</a>. You are free to switch to other Elements, Views and Learning Units at any time. The Main Navigation Buttons provide a selection history and make navigation back and forth quite comfortable.</p>
