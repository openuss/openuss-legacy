<h2>Import and Export of Learning Units</h2>
<p>Freestyle  Learning organizes the learning content into Learning Units. Learning Units can  be imported / exported to exchange with other users. </p>
<p><strong>Learning Unit Import </strong></p>
<p>Learning Units can be uploaded and downloaded, e. g. by using the Online-Platform OpenUSS. Therefore Freestyle Learning uses .fsl-files. To import these files you have to select <i>"File / Import"</i> from the menu. In the upcoming dialog you have to search for .the fsl-file to import. After a successful import process you can activate the Learning Unit from the Learning Unit Structure Tree.</p>
<p><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Keep in mind </em><em> that a Learning Unit Import of a Learning Unit with the ID of a currently installed Learning Unit is not possible. In this case you have to delete the Learning Unit with the same ID. </em></p>
<p><strong>Learning Unit Export </strong></p>
<p>If author-role is enabled you can also export Learning Units to provide the Learning Unit contents for other Freestyle Learning users.  Therefore you have to activate the unit to export by using the Learning Unit Structure Tree Dialog. Then you have to select <i>"File / Export"</i>. Alternatively you can export a Learning Unit by a right click on the Learning Unit name in the Learning Unit Structure Tree which invokes a context menu. Choose <i>"Export"</i> to start the export process.  In the upcoming dialog you can set a name and the target directory for the .fsl-file. Click on <i>"Save"</i>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Please keep in mind that the Learning Unit to export can include links on elements from Learning Units, which might be not installed on the Freestyle Learning platforms from other users. Such links can not be dissolved. </em></p>
