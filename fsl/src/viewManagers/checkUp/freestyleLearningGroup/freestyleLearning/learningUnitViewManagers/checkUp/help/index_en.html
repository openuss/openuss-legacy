<h2>Check up Help</h2>
<p>In the Check up View, you can test your knowledge gained so far. Questions concerning the content provided by the Text Study, Slide Show or other Views will be presented in different forms.</p>
<br><img src="images/screenShot_checkUp_en.jpg"></p>
<p>To start a Check Up Run, select any chapter or element from the <a href="helpMainStructureTree_en.html">Structure Tree</a> and press the <i>"Start"</i>-Button from the <a href="helpMainInteractionPanel_en.html">Interaction Panel</a>. From the upcoming dialog, you can set if you want to practice or if you want to perform an examination-like run. Therefore, select to Training Mode or Examination Mode respectively. You can also select which question alternatives you want to be displayed. </p>
<p><img src="images/screenShot_checkUp_selectQuestion_en.jpg" alt="select" width="260" height="380"></p>
<p>In  Question mode, you can select any questions from the Structure Tree to display  them in the Content Panel. In the Structure Tree, beside folders you find two  types of&nbsp; elements: <a href="helpMultipleChoice_en.html">Multiple Choice</a> and <a href="helpRelatorElements_en.html">Relator Elements</a>.</p>
<p><b>Training Mode</b></p>
<p>When you  perform your Check Up run in Training Mode, you can select any other Element  without having to finish the run. Simply press the Next Button to display the  next question of your run. Before the next question is actually shown, Freestyle  Learning will check your answers and color them green and red automatically if  they are correct or wrong respectively.</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Hint</em></strong><em>: Also <u>not</u> checking a <u>wrong</u> answer is regarded as a <u>correct</u> answer!</em></p>
<p><b>Examination Mode</b></p>
<p>In  Examination Mode the Structure Tree will be hidden so you cannot select any  elements during the run. Besides, you will get no optical feedback if you  answers are correct or not. You have to finish the run in Examination Mode to  view your results. Therefore, finishing the Examination Mode will automatically  switch to the <a href="helpEvaluationMode_en.html">Evaluation Mode</a>.</p>
