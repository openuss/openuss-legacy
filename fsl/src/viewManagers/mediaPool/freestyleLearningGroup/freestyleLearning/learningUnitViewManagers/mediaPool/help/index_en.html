<h2>Media Pool Help</h2>
<p>The Media Pool is a collection of files containing additional information and presentation for a specific Learning Unit. It is a Secondary View, so you are not likely to walk through it in a linear manner. In most cases you will be directed to Media Pool Elements by following links from any hypertext document of a Primary View, the Text Study for example. But you are also free to quarry through the Media Pool and start your personal exploration!</p>
